# Gang Busted

![Gang Busted description](./assets/gang_busted_description.png "Gang Busted")

Once I've downloaded and unzipped the archive, the main directory extracted was "data" and inside that I found this:

![Directories](./assets/directories.png)

Most of these directories were empty. To clean this, I ran thefollowing command inside the "data" directory:

```bash
$ find . -empty -type d -delete
```
